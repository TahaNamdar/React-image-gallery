      title: 'Is it necessary to upgrade the wharf?',
      body: 'As an operator of public transport under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (DDA), Transport for NSW is required to upgrade the public transport precincts to ensure equitable access is provided for all customers. <br /><br />Some public transport stations, wharves and stops do not currently meet the requirements of the federal Disability Standards for Accessible Public Transport 2002 (DSAPT). The Standards set out minimum accessibility requirements for public transport providers and ensure that people with a disability have equivalent access to public transport services. <br /><br />Upgrading public transport precincts will make the public transport network accessible to people with additional mobility requirements, parents/carers with prams and customers with luggage. For more information visit the <a href="https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects/current-projects/tap-3#Sydney_Ferries_-_TAP_3_(2019-2023)">Transport Access Program</a>.',

    {
      title: 'What is the Transport Access Program?',
      body: 'The Transport Access Program is an initiative to provide a better experience for public transport customers. Transport for NSW is in the process of improving wharves across Sydney. The aim is to upgrade these structures so that they are modern, safe and accessible. This program has most recently delivered upgraded wharves at North Sydney, Kissing Point and Woolwich. For more information visit the <a href="https://roads-waterways.transport.nsw.gov.au/maritime/projects/ferry-wharf-upgrade-program.html">Wharf Upgrade Program</a>.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Why is this upgrade being proposed?',
      body: 'Due to tidal steps at the wharf, customers with mobility needs are unable to use the ferry service without assistance. We want to ensure that everyone has equal access and that the wharf can be enjoyed by our customers for years to come.',
    },
    {
      title: 'What is a hydraulic platform? Why would it improve efficiency and safety at the wharf?',
      body: 'The proposed wharf design includes a new hydraulic platform. The platform can automatically adjust in height to improve the efficiency of berthing ferries. A hydraulic system is generally used at wharves where wave and wind conditions are stronger, allowing for safe and level passenger pick-up and drop-off. Dual platforms would allow for multiple vessels to use the wharf at once, reducing delays to passengers.',
    },
    {
      title: 'How will my feedback be used during the design process?',
      body: 'This project needs to balance a number of important requirements such as ferry operations, customer accessibility and comfort, and mitigating environmental and construction impacts. <br /><br />We have developed two concept design ideas for feedback. Both designs provide a functional, distinctive and iconic design theme that will unify and identify Sydney Harbour commuter wharves. Comments received during consultation will be considered in the selection of a preferred option to progress to the detailed design and environmental assessment stage.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Will there be another opportunity to give feedback?',
      body: 'The community will be able to provide further feedback at the Review of Environmental Factors stage where a report assessing environmental impacts will be placed on public display for comment.',
    },
    {
      title: 'When will construction take place?',
      body: 'The project is in the early stages of planning. The next stage will include the development of the design and display of the Review of Environmental Factors. Construction timeframes, including how the new wharf will be constructed, will depend on the outcomes from the Review of Environmental Factors.',

    {
      title:
        'If option 1 (build new wharf next to existing wharf) was to proceed, would the existing wharf be maintained for recreational use?',
      body: 'If option one was to proceed, it is proposed that the existing wharf structure would be retained during construction to allow ferry service to continue, however the future of the structure is yet to be determined.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Will you shut the existing wharf when construction starts?',
      body: 'If concept design option 1 (build new wharf next to the existing wharf) was to proceed, ferry transport and recreational/commercial berthing would largely continue at the existing wharf during construction , however for safety reasons there may be short durations when ferry services may be affected, and berthing is unavailable. <br /><br />If concept design option 2 (replace existing wharf) was to proceed, the wharf would close during construction. Alternative transport would be investigated, and every effort would be made to minimise disruption to the community. More information and the opportunity to provide feedback about construction impacts will be provided as part of the Review of Environmental Factors process.',
    },
    {
      title: 'How long will construction take to complete?',
      body: 'For both options, construction would take around six to eight months based on previous upgrades.',
